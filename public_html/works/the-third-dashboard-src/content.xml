    Dashboard is an algorithm-based study on the individualsâ€™ perception inside the infrastructure of the contemporary social network.

  <text>
    The Arab Spring, the Las Vegas shooting in 2019, the work of Cambridge Analytica, are all indicating the recommendation engine extensively used in the social network is becoming a liability amid the belief that everybody sorts themselves into like-minded communities, hears only like-minded views. It creates an echo chamber of falsehoods that are accepted as truths under their sheer repetition.

    The exhibition presents a duality of perspectives to demonstrate this phenomenon. By looking into the algorithm behind the infrastructure, Chapter II showcases a landscape view of the societal cohesion. As the view closes up, Chapter I tracks over the recommendation engine on YouTube, trying to render an unexpected scenery that simulates the perceived surroundings inside the social network.

    EXPERIMENT I: FAKE PERSONA
  </text>
  <text>
    FAKE PERSONA is a data-reactive experiment that tracks over the recommendation engine on YouTube.
  </text>
  <text>
    A blank Google account was created. A script is imitating user's browsing behaviours, tracking over the recommendation system throughout a topic. After a 15 minutes browsing, a fake persona gradually constructed. Videos with similar opinions reconstruct the dashboard.
  </text>
  <text>
    Thumbnail images were mapped into an environment material. During this process, the structure of the original layout disappeared, shapes and forms were distorted, information was deconstructed into a new organisation.
  </text>
  <text>
    The decisions made by the system creates a unique colouration for each persona, refecting the information they like, leading them astray in an environment.
