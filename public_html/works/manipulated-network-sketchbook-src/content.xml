    'Manipulated Network: Sketchbook' collects images generated by human-disrupted StyleGAN models. These models are manipulated in different methods: Intermediate Latent Space Truncation, weight matrices manipulation and Network Bending. It includes subsequent images with descriptive configurations that could recreate the manipulated model.

    During the implementation of [Manipulated_Network], Iâ€™ve come across plenty of quirks and oddities generated from corrupted models. These models produce impossible, distorted but realistic images, diverted from the original outputs and sometimes lead to aesthetic preoccupations. Although utilising machine autonomous, creating this collection is still like a craft: I marked configurations that cause these semantically meaningful results, tweaked and built the operation template again, and then re-examined the subsequent images. The decisions can be either arbitrary or intentional, sometimes deliberate, all in order to create potentially aesthetic results.  </text>

    During this process, I see the generative model as a tool, more like a pen or a camera operating according to human instructions.

    Therefore, I hope to use a sketchbook as a medium to house these cooperated images.

    While delicate programs autonomously produce artworks, human elements can quickly be hidden by algorithmic processes. Therefore, I see Manipulated Network: Sketchbook as an artistic technique to emphasise human elements in artworks created by generative models, expose individual variability, and find balances between machine autonomy and human creativity.
