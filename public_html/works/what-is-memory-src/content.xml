    What Is Memory showcased a series of projects utilised machine learning neural network to introduce the fiction of "truly intelligence machine".

  <text>
    It experiments with unexpected results triggered by applying the memory-prediction framework in several interdisciplinary studies, aims to explore the possibility of "artificial brain" that we might confront in the future.

  <text>
    These projects are inspired by the theory "the brain works not by computing a solution to a problem but by using memory to solve it", and then utilised generative adversarial networks (GAN) to create a hallucination of "actual thinking machine".

  <text>
    As the projects offer insights into the preoccupation emerged from the intersection of two major pursuits: The reverse engineering of the brain and artificial intelligence. The title, What Is Memory, further questioning the belief that "intelligent behaviour should be the metric of an intelligent system".
